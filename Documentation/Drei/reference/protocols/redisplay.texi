@cindex Drei redisplay
@cindex text-editor redisplay

A buffer can be on display in several panes, possibly by being located
in several Drei instances. Thus, the buffer does not concern itself with
redisplay, but assumes that whatever is using it will redisplay when
appropriate. There is no predictable definitive rule for when a Drei
instance will be redisplayed, but when it is, it will be done by calling
the following generic function.

@include fun-drei-display-drei.texi

The redisplay engine supports view-specific customization of the display
in order to facilitate such functionality as syntax highlighting. This
is done through the following two generic functions, both of which have
sensible default methods defined by @class{drei-buffer-view} and
@class{drei-syntax-view}, so if your view is a subclass of either of
these, you do not need to define them yourself.

@include fun-drei-display-drei-view-contents.texi

@include fun-drei-display-drei-view-cursor.texi
