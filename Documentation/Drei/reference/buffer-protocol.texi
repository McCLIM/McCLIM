@node Buffer Protocol
@section Buffer Protocol

The Drei buffer is what holds textual and other objects to be
edited and displayed.  Conceptually, the buffer is a potentially
large sequence of objects, most of which are expected to be
characters (the full Unicode character set is supported).  However,
Drei buffers can contain any Common Lisp objects, as long as the
redisplay engine knows how to render them.

The Drei buffer implementation differs from that of a vector, because it
allows for very efficient editing operations, such as inserting and
removing objects at arbitrary offsets.

In addition, the Drei buffer protocols defines that concept of a
mark.

@node Implementation Hints
@subsection Implementation Hints

The buffer is implemented as lines organized in a 2-3-tree.  The
leaves of the tree contain the lines, and the internal nodes contain
additional information of the left subtree (if it is a 2-node) or the
left and the middle subtree (if it is a 3-node).  Two pieces of
information are stored: The number of lines in up to and including
the subtree and the total number of objects up to an including the
subtree.  This organization allows us to determine, the line number
and object position of any mark in O(log N) where N is the number of
lines.

A line is an instance of the `buffer-line' class.  A line can either
be open or closed.  A closed line is represented as a sequence.  The
exact type of the sequence depends on the objects contained in the
line.  If the line contains only characters of type base-char, then
the sequence is of type base-string.  If the line contains only
characters, but not of type base-char, the sequence is a string.
Otherwise it is a vector of arbitrary objects.  This way, closed
lines containing characters with code points below 256 have a compact
representation with 8 bits per character while still allowing for
arbitrary objects when necessary.  An open line is represented as a
cursorchain of objects.

Marks in a closed line are represented as an integer offset into the
sequence.  Marks in an open line are represented as flexicursors.

When a line is opened, it is converted to a cursorchain.  When a line
is closed, it is examined to determine whether it contains
non-character objects, in which case it is converted to a vector of
objects.  If contains only characters, but it contains characters
with code points above what can be represented in a base-char, it is
converted to a string.  If it contains only base-chars, it is
converted to a base-string.

A mark contains two slots: a flexicursor that determines which line it
is on, and either an integer (if the line is closed) that determines
the offset within the line or another flexicursor (if the line is
open).  For each line, open or closed, a list of weak references to
marks into that line is kept.

Lines are closed according to a LRU scheme.  Whenever objects are
inserted to or deleted from a line, it becomes the most recently used
line.  We keep a fixed number of open lines so that when a line is
opened and the threshold is reached, the least recently used line is
closed.
