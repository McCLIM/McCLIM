@deffn {Macro} {@symbol{with-output-to-output-record,clim}} (stream &optional record-type record &rest initargs) &body body
Creates a new output record of type @var{record-type} and then captures
the output of @var{body} into the new output record.  The cursor
position of @var{stream} is initially bound to (0,0).  If @var{record}
is supplied, it is the name of a variable that will be lexically bound
to the new output record inside the body.  @var{initargs} are CLOS
initargs that are passed to @code{make-instance} when the new output
record is created.  It returns the created output record.  The
@var{stream} argument is a symbol that is bound to an output recording
stream.  If it is @code{t}, @code{*standard-output*} is used.
