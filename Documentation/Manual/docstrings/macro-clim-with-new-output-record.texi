@deffn {Macro} {@symbol{with-new-output-record,clim}} (stream &optional record-type record &rest initargs) &body body
Creates a new output record of type @var{record-type} and then captures
the output of @var{body} into the new output record, and inserts the new
record into the current "open" output record associated with
@var{stream}.  If @var{record} is supplied, it is the name of a variable
that will be lexically bound to the new output record inside the
body. @var{initargs} are CLOS initargs that are passed to
@code{make-instance} when the new output record is created.  It returns
the created output record.  The @var{stream} argument is a symbol that
is bound to an output recording stream. If it is @code{t},
@code{*standard-output*} is used.
