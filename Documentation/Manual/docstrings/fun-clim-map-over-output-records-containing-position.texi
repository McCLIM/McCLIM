@deffn {Generic Function} {@symbol{map-over-output-records-containing-position,clim}}@
  function record x y &optional x-offset y-offset &rest function-args
Maps over all of the children of @var{record} that contain the point at
(@var{x},@var{y}), calling @var{function} on each one.  @var{function} is
a function of one or more arguments, the first argument being the record
containing the point.  @var{function} is also called with all of
@var{function-args} as @code{apply} arguments.

If there are multiple records that contain the point,
@code{map-over-output-records-containing-position} hits the most
recently inserted record first and the least recently inserted record
last.  Otherwise, the order in which the records are traversed is
unspecified.
