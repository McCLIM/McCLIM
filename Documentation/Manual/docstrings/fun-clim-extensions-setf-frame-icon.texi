@deffn {Generic Function} {@symbol{@setf{frame-icon},clim-extensions}} new-value frame
Set icon or icons of @var{frame} to @var{new-value}.

@var{new-value} must be a @class{clim-extensions:image-pattern} or a
sequence of those.  If a sequence is supplied, the window manager is
instructed to prefer the first element, if possible.  Some window
managers select different icons for different purposes based on the icon
sizes.  This function also sets @var{new-value} as the icon(s) of the
top-level sheet of @var{frame}.
