@deffn {Generic Function} {@symbol{map-over-output-records-overlapping-region,clim}}@
  function record region &optional x-offset y-offset &rest function-args
Maps over all of the children of @var{record} that overlap the
@var{region}, calling @var{function} on each one.  @var{function} is a
function of one or more arguments, the first argument being the record
overlapping the region.  @var{function} is also called with all of
@var{function-args} as @code{apply} arguments.

If there are multiple records that overlap the region and that overlap
each other, @code{map-over-output-records-overlapping-region} hits the least
recently inserted record first and the most recently inserted record
last.  Otherwise, the order in which the records are traversed is
unspecified.
