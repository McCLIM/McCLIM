;;; (AH) McCLIM bug of the day:
;;;
;;; (I haven't looked in detail at the spec or McCLIM to confirm my
;;; assumptions here, but as I understand things..)  CLIM regions are
;;; immutable. Output records ARE mutable. A McCLIM output record can
;;; be used as a rectangular region corresponding to its bounding
;;; rectangle.  But this bounding rectangle is not immutable! So,
;;; region operations such as region-union may build a rectangle-set
;;; capturing the mutable output-record object, violating the
;;; immutability of regions and causing widespread panic and
;;; confusion.
