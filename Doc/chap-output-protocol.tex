\section{Protocol Changes}

\Defgeneric {line-style-effective-thickness} {line-style medium}

Returns the thickness in device units of a line,
rendered on \textit{medium} with the style \textit{line-style}.

\Defgeneric {(setf output-record-parent)} {parent record}

Set the parent of the output record \textit{record}
to \textit{parent}.  The value of \textit{parent} may be an output
record or \texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {replay-output-record}
{(record stream \optional region x-offset y-offset)}

Displays the output captured by \textit{record} on the
\textit{stream}, exactly as it was originally captured. The current
user transformation, line style, text style, ink and clipping region
of \textit{stream} are all ignored. Instead, these are gotten from the
output record.

Only those records that overlap \textit{region} are displayed.
