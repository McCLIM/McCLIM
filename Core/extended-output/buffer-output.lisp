;;; The implementation of displaying and drawing of the "text" buffer. Here we
;;; implement thins like a text direction and margins.

(in-package #:climi)

;;; We need to use a stealth mixin here because cluffer calls change-class on
;;; open/closed-line so our class would be lost in no time.
;;;
;;; Note that the logical line may span multiple lines on the screen due to
;;; the line wrap.  Also the line direction is not always left-to-right.
;;;
;;; Instead of having "x" and "y" parts of various positions and offsets we
;;; use points in the geometrical sense so we don't need to deal with multiple
;;; values directly. That improves the code robustness and clarity.
