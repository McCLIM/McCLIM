;;;; Coordinate Swizzling

;;; This implements what I call "coordinate swizzling", the illusion that
;;; sheets can be arbitrary large. The key idea here is that there is a
;;; certain kind freedom in choosing the native transformation. A little
;;; diagram to illustrate the involved transformations:

;;;
;;;                  NT                           NT = native transformation
;;;    sheet  ---------------->  mirror          PNT = parent's NT
;;;      |                         |              MT = mirror transformation
;;;      |                         |               T = sheet transformation
;;;      |                         |
;;;    T |                         | MT
;;;      |                         |
;;;      |                         |
;;;      |                         |
;;;      v          PNT            v
;;;    parent ----------------> parent
;;;                             mirror
;;;

;;; To setup both the mirror transformation (MT) and the mirror region (MR),
;;; we start with the mirror region. The window systems limitations are here:
;;; We can only have a certain size and its upper-left corner must be at the
;;; origin.

;;; Now the parent already has a mirror region (PMR) assigned, which obeys to
;;; the very same size restrictions. Since every part of MR outside of (PMR o
;;; MT^-1) is not visible, the first idea is to just clip it by the visible
;;; part:

;;;  MR_1 = intersection (SR o NT, PMR o MT^-1)             [mirror space]

;;; Since both NT and MT^-1 are not yet known let us reformulate that region
;;; in the parent mirror space:

;;;  MR_2 = MR_1 o MT                                       [parent mirror space]
;;;       = intersection (SR o NT, PMR o MT^-1) o MT
;;;       = intersection (SR o NT o MT, PMR o MT^-1 o MT)
;;;       = intersection (SR o (T o PNT o MT^-1) o MT, PMR)
;;;       = intersection (SR o T o PNT, PMR)

;;; MR_2 now is a good candidate for a mirror region. Unfortunately it is
;;; still in parent mirror space, so we transform it back, yielding MR_3:

;;;  MR_3 = MR_2 o MT^-1
;;;       = intersection (SR o T o PNT, PMR) o MT^-1

;;; Here the only unknown is the mirror transformation MT, we can still
;;; choose any as long as the window system limitations are met for both MR
;;; and MT.

;;; 1. MT should be a translation, whose delta x and y components are within
;;;    limits.

;;; 2. The size limitation of MR is already met, since MR_3's size is no
;;;    larger than PMR's size (which mets the limitations). [Remember that MT
;;;    was defined to be some translation].

;;; 3. MR_3's upper left corner should also be at the origin which nicely
;;;    defines MT^-1: Just choose this upper left corner coordinates as MT's x
;;;    and y deltas.

;;; So we can meet all criteria. The NT can easily be set up by the identity:

;;;    NT = T o PNT o MT^-1

;;; Notes

;;; . when the native transformation changes, we need to:

;;;  a. Redraw the mirror's contents since the mapping from the sheet space
;;;     to the mirror space (that is the native transformation) just changed.
;;;     Translational changes in the native transformation can be catered by
;;;     blittering, but then have a nice synchronization problem: Suppose
;;;     a repaint event is underway as we blitter from some region R_1 to
;;;     region R_2. Say the repaint event's region intersects with R_1. In
;;;     this case we just blittered pixels which were considered dirty into
;;;     R_2. Redrawing R_1 now does not repair the defect, since R_2 now also
;;;     contains dirty pixels. => oops, redraw error.
;;
;;;  b. Since the above above calculation took the parent's native
;;;     transformation into account, (and even the naively wanted mirror
;;;     region depends on the parent's native transformation), we need to
;;;     redo mirror geometry calculation for any child.
;;
;;;  c. I imagine more aggressive output records which remember the actual
;;;     octets which need to be send to the X server. These would contain
;;;     mirror coordinates and will need to be recalculated, when the native
;;;     transformation changes.

;;; => Changing the native transformation can be expensive, so we want a way
;;;    to minimize changes to the native transformation.

;;; What did we do? We clipped the wanted mirror region, SR o NT, inside the
;;; parent's mirror region to meet the window system limitations. We can make
;;; this clip region larger as long as we still come up with an mirror region,
;;; which meets the limits.
