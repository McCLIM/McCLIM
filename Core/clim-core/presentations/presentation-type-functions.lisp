;;; PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP suffers from some of the same problems as
;;; CL:SUBTYPEP, most (but sadly not all) of which were solved in
;;; H. Baker "A Decision Procedure for SUBTYPEP"; additionally, it
;;; suffers from the behaviour being underspecified, as CLIM
;;; documentation did not have the years of polish that CLtS did.
;;;
;;; So you might wonder why, instead of copying or using directly some
;;; decent Public Domain subtype code (such as that found in SBCL,
;;; implementing CL:SUBTYPEP), there's this slightly wonky
;;; implementation here.  Well, some of the answer lies in the fact
;;; that the subtype relationships answered by this predicate are not
;;; in fact analogous to CL's type system.  The major use of
;;; PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP seems to be for determining whether a
;;; presentation is applicable as input to a translator (including the
;;; default translator, transforming an object to itself); actually,
;;; the first step is taken by STUPID-SUBTYPEP, but that I believe is
;;; simply intended to be a short-circuiting conservative version of
;;; PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP.
;;;
;;; Most presentation types in CLIM are hierarchically arranged by
;;; single-inheritance, and SUBTYPEP relations on the hierarchy are
;;; easy to determine: simply walk up the hierarchy until you find the
;;; putative supertype (in which case the answer is T, T unless the
;;; type's parameters are wrong) or you find the universal supertype
;;; (in which case the answer is NIL, T.  There are numerous wrinkles,
;;; however...
;;;
;;; (1) the NIL presentation type is the universal subtype, breaking
;;;     the single-inheritance of the hierarchy.  This isn't too bad,
;;;     because it can be special-cased.
;;;
;;; (2) union types can be constructed, destroying the
;;;     single-inheritance hierarchy (when used as a subtype).
;;;
;;; (3) union types can give rise to ambiguity.  For example, is the
;;;     NUMBER presentation type subtypep (OR REAL COMPLEX)?  What
;;;     about (INTEGER 3 6) subtypep (OR (INTEGER 3 4) (INTEGER 5 6))?
;;;     Is (OR A B) subtypep (OR B A)?  The answer to this last
;;;     question is not obvious, as the two types have different
;;;     ACCEPT behaviour if A and B have any Lisp objects in common,
;;;     even if the presentation types are hierarchically unrelated...
;;;
;;; (4) intersection types can be constructed, destroying the
;;;     single-inheritance hierarchy (when used as a supertype).  This
;;;     is partially mitigated by the explicit documentation that the
;;;     first type in the AND type's parameters is privileged and
;;;     treated specially by ACCEPT.
;;;
;;; Given these difficulties, I'm aiming for roughly expected
;;; behaviour from STUPID- and PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP, rather than
;;; something which has a comprehensive understanding of presentation
;;; types and the Lisp object universe (as this would be unachievable
;;; anyway: the user can write arbitrary PRESENTATION-TYPEP
;;; functions); PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP should not be thought of as a
;;; predicate over sets of Lisp objects, but simply a formal predicate
;;; over a graph of names.  This gives rise to the implementation
;;; below for OR and AND types, and the hierarchical walk for all
;;; other types.  CSR, 2007-01-10
