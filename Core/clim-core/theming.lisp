;;; 3D-BORDER-MIXIN class can be used to add a 3D-ish border to

;;;  :border-width       The width of the border
;;;  :border-style       The border's style one of :inset, :outset, :groove, :ridge, :solid,

;;;                      [:dotted and :dashed are not yet implemented]
;;;
;;;  :border-color       The border's color
;;;                      [Not implemented yet]
;;;
;;; [These options are modelled after CSS].
;;;
;;; When using 3D-BORDER-MIXIN, one should query the pane's inner
;;; region, where drawing should take place, by PANE-INNER-REGION.
