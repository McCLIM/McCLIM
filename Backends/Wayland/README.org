* Wayland Backend (warning: work-in-progress quality!)

This is currently in a proof-of-concept state for getting some early code review. I'm currently learning both CLIM, McCLIM, and Wayland so I'm sure I'm "doing it wrong" in quite a few places.

I'm testing this on a GUIX OS using sway as my wayland compositor. I haven't yet tested in a GNOME or KDE contexts at all.

I plan to rebase this branch again McCLIM/master frequently as I work.

* What "works"
1. A visual window can been seen on the screen
2. It resizes in sway as it's moved around
3. The sway keychord for quitting an app (s-M-q on mine) kinda works, but not without error.
4. =destroy-port= works
5. Some keyboard and pointer... at least debug logging -- untested in a CLIM app.
6. Basic rendering of window elements e.g. scroll bars

* What doesn't work as of 2022-11-19
1. Everything else :) TODO list now being maintained below.


* Running

** Dependencies
This currently requires my feature branch of Andrew Soutar's great =cl-wayland-client= package which adds extra FFI bindings for EGL and convenience path search for finding the wayland protocol libraries. Neither are on quicklisp currently. I'll be seeing if upstreaming is a possibility but I haven't testing for non-breaking on more mainstream distros.

I realize this is a weakness.

** Environment
You'll need development library for wayland and mesa. For debian/ubuntu based distributions, it usually means the =*-dev= packages. On Guix, I'm doing this in a dedicated dev environment:
#+begin_src sh
guix shell sbcl mesa wayland wayland-protocols libxkbcommon
#+end_src

I needed to start emacs in a way it could find the wayland protocal specs and libraries. You might not need this if you aren't sandboxing your environment:
#+begin_src sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT/lib" emacs &
#+end_src

And of course a way to teach your lisp's ASDF about the McCLIM branch. I do this via quicklisp and its local-projects facility.

* Points of Interest

** PROCESS-NEXT-EVENT

- The wayland events come in as methods on CLOS objects sometimes with =:after= method combinations, each doing its own call to DISTRIBUTE-EVENT.
- I haven't dedicated much time to figuring out how to do this in a way that is closer in style to the CLX backend and I've only been testing in a multi-processor based system. So, it's triggering the reading of waylend events and just returning =T=, no =:timeout= or =:wait-function:=.

** PORT-SET-MIRROR-GEOMETRY

Between it and PORT-ENABLE-SHEET... I'm not sure I'm doing the correct port -> graft -> mirror initialization / realization flow correctly.

** There are not many files on purpose at the moment.
For example, I haven't split PORT and GRAFTS into their own files like other backends. It will happen eventually as I get a better understanding.

* My silly testing app
It shows the window on the screen but there is still a lot that doesn't work and is just "wishful"

* Remaining TODOs

** TODO SHM buffers and medium

** TODO EGL / OpenGL fonts
ugh.

** TODO OpenGL Medium rendering
Currently it's /very/ naive and doesn't handle CLIM designs/inks well e.g. flipping inks. I'm beginning to think I'll need my own light, ui scene graph

** TODO Good Double buffering / incremental rendering
Currently we are preparing a fresh frame but the repaint doesn't happen that often so blank buffers get swapped.

*** TODO Partial OpenGL buffer rendering
updating only a damaged region.

** TODO Pointer Drag N' Drop

** TODO Context-based pointer images

** TODO Support other non-WLroots based WMs

*** TODO Mutter

*** TODO Kwin

** TODO Separate OpenGL pane gadget
Even though we are rendering the whole UI via the wayland-egl-medium, I would still like there to be a pane that app developers could have as their own "canvas"
- How does Blender do it?

** TODO Run demos with wayland-ffi backend

*** TODO gadget tests

** TODO CJK input?
